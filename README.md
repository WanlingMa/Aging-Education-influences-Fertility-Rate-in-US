# The Impact of Aging Population and Education Attainment on Fertility Rate in US over 1990 to 2020

## Overview

This repo provides all scripts, sources, and codes to reproduce the paper **The Impact of Aging Population and Education Attainment on Fertility Rate in US over 1990 to 2020**. The dataset was retrieved from the Our World in Data.

## Paper Abstract

This paper investigates the relationship between the aging population rate, educational attainment, and fertility rates in the United States over a thirty-year period from 1990 to 2020. Through a detailed analysis using data from the United Nations and the World Bank, we found that higher educational attainment is associated with lower fertility rates, while an increase in the working-age population percentage positively affects fertility. These findings highlight the significant impact of demographic and educational shifts on the nation's fertility trends. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing policies that address the challenges and opportunities of an evolving society.
